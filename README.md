How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  * Graphics Design - I have a deeper understanding of the process behind creating a 3D scene by using textures, lighting effects and shaders.
  * Visual Placement - Through this project I gained insights on organizing elements and establishing focal points.
  * Problem Solving - Encountering and solving issues.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
  * The process I followed involved requirements gathering, research, concept, prototyping, design, and implementation.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  * Requirements Gathering - When starting a new project, time needs to be invested to understand the project requirements and objectives.
  * Research - Expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with advancements.  Research helps me to explore new design techniques, new technologies, and trends.
  * Concept Development - Explore different ideas and visual directions.  This helps in considering user needs, aesthetics, and usability.
  * Prototyping - Prototyping helped me validate my design ideas before investing significant time and effort.
  * Design - Taking time to consider the visual hierarchy and color schemes.
  * Implementation - To translate the design specifications into functional code, following best practices and coding structures.

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  * Object-Oriented Programming - I applied OOP principles by using classes and objects that represent entities within the 3D scene, such as models, cameras, lights, and materials. 
How did iteration factor into your development?
  * Design Iteration - I went through multiple iterations to refine my initial concept.
  * Prototyping - Creation of basic prototypes were used to validate my design decisions.
  * Bug Fixing and Debugging - Iteration is required to identify issues and resolve them.
  * Enhancements - I was able to identify opportunities to enhance my 3D scene.  For example: The book texture being manipulated to have a more realistic effect.  
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  * Each milestone built upon the previous.  This allowed  me to methodically piece together each element that was the focus of each  each milestone.
    
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?  
  * Data Visualizations - The skills I learned in this course equip me with the knowledge and skills needed to analyze and visualize complex data.
  * Programming - Computational graphics and visualizations require programming skills by utilizing graphics libraries.  
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  * Leveraging my knowledge and skills in computational graphics and visualizations, I can explore diverse professional pathways across technology, design, research, marketing, healthcare, and others.  The skills I learned enable me to communicate data visually, create immersive experiences, and leverage the power of graphics to solve complex problems and drive innovation in various industries.
